        PRIME NUMBER VERIFICATION:

        A number is a prime if it only has 4 divisors, or 2 in natural numbers, been -+1 and
        the very number itself in both positive or negative version (therefore, natural ones
        will only have as divisors 1 and the number). For this program we'll use this second
        aception in order to simplify operations.

        Knowing that every natural number has at least 2 divisors, whenever we succeed just
        once on dividing a number which isn't 1 or whatever number we'd originally chose, this
        will automatically discard this number as a prime. Nonetheless, we only need to check
        divisors for the square root-size worth of the number, because all the following number will
        cuase a non-integer coeficent.

        Neither 1 nor 0 are prime numbers, that is, 2 is the one we'll start checking.

        EUCLID'S ALGORITHM:

        It's used to find iteratively the greatest common divisor between two numbers.
        We start up with an expression with the form: a = c*b + d, which stands for the
        Remainder Theorem:
        a > Dividend
        b > Divisor
        c > Coeficent
        d > Remainder

        This could be applied recursively by following the next steps:
        1. Find the greatest coeficent and calculating it's remainder
        2. Because MATH; gcd(a,b) <-> gcd(b, d). Applying this simplifies the problem in size
        3. Repeat until the remainder reaches 0, which means that the divisor on that exact
           iteration, is the actual gcd of the original numbers.
